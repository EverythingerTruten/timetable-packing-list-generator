# timetable-packing-list-generator
Python program for generating a handy packing list for weekly school timetables

I don't know if anyone else will find this code useful but I had some spare time so decided to speed up this easy to automate task.

**Usage:**
1. Get your timetable as an .xlsx file either through Excel or Google Sheets
2. Set up the preferences.txt file by replacing the specified lines without any additional spaces or characters
  a) Ignored classes with comma-seperated names
  b) The class left at home (I have just one so that's why it's not a list) with the name of it
3. Run the program - first select the .xlsx file, then the .txt file
4. Upload your updated .xlsx file to Google Sheets or view it again in Excel
5. THE END
